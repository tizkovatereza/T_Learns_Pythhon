Welcome to our list of AI agents.
We structured the list into two parts:
- [Open source projects](#open_hands-open-source-projects)
- [Closed-source projects and companies](#lock-closed-source-projects-and-companies)

The list is done according to our best knowledge, although definitely not comprehensive. Check out also <a href="https://github.com/e2b-dev/awesome-sdks-for-ai-agents">the Awesome List of SDKs for AI Agents</a>.
